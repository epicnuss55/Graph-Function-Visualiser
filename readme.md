# Graph Function Visualiser
## Introduction
Graph Function Visualiser, or GFV, is a simple mathematical cartasien graph function grapher. GFV can be used as a basic calculator graph. There are two versions of the project, one made in pure html/css/javascript and one made with java.

### java
The java version was made in java 14. The java version would probably work on prior versions if you're just copying the code over, but I recommended that you use java 14 or higher. The java version isn't dynamic, but you can choose from a set ammount of functions given.

#### Current functions
The current functions for GFV include:
```
Turning point (Parabola)
X-Intercept (Parabola)
Circle graph (Circles don't count as a function, but i added this one anyways)
Exponential function (exponential)
Power function (exponential)
Linear
Cubic function (Like the power except locked on cubed)
```

Calculations are shown here in the same order
```
y = a(x - b)^2 + c
y = (x + a)(x + b) + c
(x + a)^2 + (x + b)^2 = c^2
y = a^(x + b) + c
y = ax^b + c
y = a(x + b) + c
y = a(x + b)^3 + c
```
### javascript
The javascript version is the new and more dynamic version of the same project. The javascript version is still basic, but more accurate than the java version.

#### Supported mathematical operators
```
Power of: n^p
sine: sin(n)
cosine: cos(n)
logarithm (base 2 and 10): log2(n) | log10(n)
```

## Disclaimer
This grapher is very basic! If you're going to use this for any type of practical purpose, please use something that would give more accuracy (like Desmos's graphing calculator).

## Future plans
- None, project is probably finished, hit me up on twitter if you want me to add something new.
