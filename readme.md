# Graph Function Visualiser
## Introduction
Graph Function Visualiser, or GFV, is a simple java-based mathematical cartasien graph function grapher. GFV can be used as a basic calculator graph. This was made in java 14, it would probably work on prior versions if you're just copying the code over, but I recommended that you use java 14 or higher.

## Current functions
The current functions for GFV include:
```
Turning point (Parabola)
X-Intercept (Parabola)
Circle graph
Exponential function (exponential)
Power function (exponential)
Linear
Cubic function (Like the power except locked on cubed)
```

Calculations are shown here in the same order
```
y = a(x - b)^2 + c
y = (x + a)(x + b) + c
(x + a)^2 + (x + b)^2 = c^2
y = a^(x + b) + c
y = ax^b + c
y = a(x + b) + c
y = a(x + b)^3 + c
```

## Future plans
- Add more functions
